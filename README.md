# DevOps with Docker, Kubernetes, and Kyverno  

## Overview  

Welcome to my DevOps project! This repository highlights my experience in building and managing containerized applications with a focus on policy enforcement, container orchestration, and automation. Leveraging **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Kyverno**, I have implemented a secure and scalable workflow to deploy and govern modern applications effectively.  

This project includes practical use cases of **Kyverno** for managing Kubernetes policies, ensuring compliance, and automating best practices. **GitHub Actions** is utilized for continuous integration and deployment, streamlining the development lifecycle.  

> **Key Technologies Used:**  
> - **Docker**: For creating lightweight, portable containers.  
> - **Kubernetes**: To orchestrate and manage containers in a scalable manner.  
> - **Kyverno**: For policy enforcement and automation within Kubernetes.  
> - **GitHub Actions**: To automate CI/CD workflows for efficient development.

## Project Highlights  

### 1. **Dockerizing the Application**  
   The project begins by creating a Dockerized Python-based application. Packaging the application into a container ensures portability and consistency across development, testing, and production environments.  

### 2. **Policy Management with Kyverno**  
   **Kyverno** was integrated into the Kubernetes workflow to:  
   - Enforce compliance policies such as mandatory metadata labels and allowed image registries.  
   - Automate repetitive tasks like adding resource labels and validating configurations.  
   - Enhance security by preventing unapproved deployments.  

### 3. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
   Implemented **GitHub Actions** for automating the build, test, and deployment pipelines. Key features of the workflow include:  
   - Linting and testing code on every push.  
   - Building and pushing Docker images to a container registry.  
   - Automatically deploying the application to Kubernetes.  

### 4. **Kubernetes Deployments**  
   Deployed the application on a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging the following components:  
   - **Deployment**: Ensures the application runs reliably in containers.  
   - **Services**: Exposes the application to allow network access.  
   - **ConfigMaps/Secrets**: Manages application configuration and sensitive data securely.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Docker installed and running.  
- Kubernetes cluster (local or remote) configured with `kubectl`.  
- Access to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or Google Container Registry).  
- Kyverno installed in your Kubernetes cluster.  

### Steps to Run the Project  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git  
   cd your-repo
   ```
Build the Docker Image:

```
docker build -t your-app-name:latest .
```  
Push the Docker Image to a Registry:

```
docker tag your-app-name:latest your-registry/your-app-name:latest  
docker push your-registry/your-app-name:latest
``` 
Deploy to Kubernetes:
Apply the Kubernetes manifests:

```
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml  
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
```  
Enforce Kyverno Policies:
Add policies to the cluster for compliance and security:

```
kubectl apply -f kyverno/policies/
```  
Verify the Application:
Access the application through the Kubernetes service using:

```
kubectl get svc
```
